Thats the React version of my Clients personal app.
I decided to make it public, so I can share the idea.
It started simple, just to control my job informations and stuff. But I decided to further and now, I can look it from a great perspective.
  That's an app where I pretend to automatizate a lot of easy things, but that requires a lot of humans time.
  They are some easy tasks, but I have to deal with them everyday. 
    So, I realized that I'm a programmer, and my duty is to automatizate all that and try to take the maximum of it, learning every time!
    
    
   I feel like I already had a GREAT work and will continue to upload every improvement in here!
